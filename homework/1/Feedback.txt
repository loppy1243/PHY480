# HW grading scale: check(+) --> excellent (good code and analysis) 
#                   check    --> satisfactory (minor shortcomings in code and/or analysis)
#                   check(-) --> significant problems w/code or analysis

1) Problem 1 (area.cpp embellishments): 

Your code looks great. 

2)Problem 2 (sum up/down): 

Again, nice job writing it in a very general/extendable way. You analysis is correct-- this is basically
the same problem we did in class (1+eps+eps... versus eps + eps + ...+ 1).


3) Problem 3 (bessel functions): 

Your analysis is right on the money. You were one of a small handful who realized 
that by making separate error plots using up/gsl and down/gsl, one can make sense of the up/down 
relative error plots (i.e., figure out which is the culprit when the relative difference is ~ 1).

(If interested, you can understand numerical value of the slope between x=1 and 10
using the short-distance x << l expressions of the spherical bessel and neumann functions. 
I wonder if one can play similar games for the VERY steep 
region above x = 30 using the asymptotic x >> l expressions for jl(x) and nl(x).)



##### HW grade = check(+). 

Nice job. Your codes are sophisticated and well written, and you hit all the main points 
asked for in the analysis. [Sorry for the delay. I though I had graded everyone over the weekend, and 
I only noticed yours just now.]
