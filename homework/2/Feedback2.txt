# Grading Scale: check(+) --> excellent codes and analysis
                 check    --> satisfactory (missing small gaps in analysis or codes)
                 check(-) --> unsatisfactory (significant problems with codes/analysis or incomplete)  

Your codes are very sophisticated, but something looks wrong with the Milne results. (Recall from the notes,
the error should be N^-4 for Simpsons and N^-6 for Milne).  

Did you forget to commit/push your analysis for parts b, c, and the bonus e that you started? 

Grade: check(-)
