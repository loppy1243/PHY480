Hi, just checking if you forgot to commit/push your HW3. If not, just a reminder to 
please have it before 4pm Friday.

Revised grade: check(+). Good job-- note that the eigenvectors that come out of the GSL routine are undefined up to a phase,
hence why your 2nd graph has some wf's that are flipped by a sign. You can impose the same phase by hand.
